# Coursera_Capstone
This repository is a capstone project for IBM's Data Science Professional Certificate (Feb 2020). This project is an applied example (more practice) of an unsupervised ML algorithm (KMeans Clustering) on San Francisco neighborhoods, more specifically to find similarities between SF's least and most populated neighborhoods.
